        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here are more details on how we use your information (which may include personal information):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pairing with device and synchronize data:</strong> We will collect information about accounts,
            device and network to synchronize data, enable the device to accept plug-in instruction, and upload data to
            server (applicable to specific functions/services only).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Viewing real-time image:</strong> You can view the real-time image from time to time on your phone.
            Thus, we will collect information about current image time, video play speed, image quality option, image
            scaling and volume. In addition, you can take a screenshot or record the current real-time image. Real-time
            image screenshot/video recordings will be saved on your phone instead of being uploaded to any server. You
            can also control the angle with the arrow keys. To do this, we will send your control instructions to the
            device.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Home surveillance assistant:</strong> You can enable or disable the Home surveillance assistant
            function. If enabled, video recording function will be triggered when images change within the detection
            range of the camera. You can set the starting and ending time of home surveillance function, and the alter
            interval to avoid interruption from one same event. You can view the videos online on your phone. To do
            this, we will collect information about your settings on sensitivity, home surveillance durations, alter
            interval, alter push notification on/off and push notification types.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Video playback:</strong> You can view videos of various types in the plug-in. To do this, we will
            collect and encrypt the videos triggered by Home Surveillance Assistant and baby cry, as well as the
            triggering events, and save these encrypted data in a secure server. The videos will be stored on the
            server. To do this, we will collect information related to your network information related to recording,
            including recording date, recording time, trigger event, recording video duration, sound settings, play
            speed.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Baby crying sound detection:</strong> When baby crying sound detection function is enabled, you will
            receive a push notification if such event occurred. We process it locally and do not upload it to the cloud.
            In order to realize this function, we will collect information about your Mi account and the on/off status
            of baby crying sound push notification.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Manage storage card: </strong>You can choose to store the video on a memory card and to view at any
            time. If the storage space of the memory card is insufficient, new videos will be automatically overwritten
            previous contents, and you can manage the videos in the plug-in as needed. Thus, we will collect memory card
            information (storage status, remaining capacity, memory switch, recording mode).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Two-way talkback:</strong> You can view information about the real-time image in the plug-in and
            talk with the visitor with two-way talkback function. We will not collect information about your
            conversations, unless you select to record current real-time image before using the two-way talkback
            function. <strong>But under no circumstances will we try to read or identify your conversation.</strong>
        </li>
        <li><strong>To collect users’ feedbacks:</strong> The feedbacks you provide are extremely valuable in helping us
            improve our services. In order to follow up with your feedback, Imilab may use the personal information you
            provide to contact you and to keep records.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Sending notifications:</strong> The device will send you corresponding notifications according to
            triggering events. For example, you can set the device to send notifications to your phone when monitored
            image changes. In order to do so, we will collect information about your push settings. You can disable push
