			<li><span>●</span><b><em>Personalized voice alert: </em>If this function is enabled, the device will play designated voice message when the device detects that someone is moving. To do this, we will collect information about your recorded voice message, recording time and duration.</b></li>
			<li><span>●</span><b><em>Two-way talkback: </em>You can view information about the live image in the plug-in and talk with the visitor with two-way talkback function.

			<li><span>●</span><b><em>To collect user feedback: </em>The feedback you provide is extremely valuable in helping us improve our services. In order to track your feedback, Hualai may use the personal information you provide to contact you and to keep records.</b></li>
