In particular, we will ensure that all such transfers meet the requirements of applicable local data protection laws by implementing the appropriate safeguards.\10Xiaomi may process or back up your personal information using overseas facilities operated and controlled by Xiaomi Home. Currently, Xiaomi has data centers in Beijing, the United States, Singapore, and Germany. These overseas jurisdictions may or may not have data protection laws that are similar to the data protection laws of your jurisdiction.
